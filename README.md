## Description üìù

JATE (Just Another Text Editor) is a progressive web app that, quite literally, lets you just edit text on the application. There's no other purpose to it, lol.

JATE was built using primarily webpack and some associated functions, such as WebpackPWAManifest to name one, to allow the application to serve up and bundle all of this application's necessary frontend components. The app also used service workers to allow for caching for faster loading as well as offline usage. 
Since this application doesn't use databases such as MongoDB or MySQL, it stores information on the client's side using IndexedDB and local storage. Through IndexedDB, we can store and retrieve the text that the user writes without any extra overhead on the server side.
